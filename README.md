# Smart Workplace Dashboard Workshop

A streamlined workshop teaching Document Driven Development (DDD) through building a Smart Workplace Dashboard. Participants create three focused widgets that help HR teams and office managers monitor workplace conditions and optimize employee experience using api.stillriver.info and mock data.

## Workshop Overview

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this 2-hour workshop, participants will:
- Write effective DDD specifications for dashboard components
- Generate React components using AI agents
- Integrate multiple API endpoints via api.stillriver.info
- Handle asynchronous data and error states
- Measure productivity improvements with AI-driven development

### What We'll Build
A focused dashboard with three core widgets:
- **Office Weather Monitor** - Current conditions and commute impact
- **Meeting Time Finder** - Cross-timezone meeting scheduler
- **Office Pulse** - Simple wellness and utilization metrics

### Technical Requirements
- Node.js and npm installed
- Internet access (uses Stillriver API proxy)
- Code editor (VS Code)
- Chrome browser
- Access to Claude

## üöÄ Quick Start for Workshop Participants

### Step 1: Get the Code
```bash
# Clone the workshop repository
git clone https://github.com/stillrivercode/smart-workplace.git
cd smart-workplace

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Step 2: Start Development
```bash
# Start the development server
cd app
npm install
npm start
```

Your workshop environment is now ready! The app will open at `http://localhost:3000`.

### API Setup - Already Done! ‚úÖ
This workshop uses **Stillriver API** (api.stillriver.info) as a proxy for API Ninjas endpoints. **No API keys or registration required** - everything works out of the box for workshop participants.
