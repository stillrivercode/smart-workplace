# Bandit Configuration File
# This configuration helps reduce false positives in security scanning

[bandit]
# Exclude test directories and virtual environments from security scanning
# Test code often uses patterns that would be unsafe in production
# Virtual environments contain third-party code we don't control
exclude: /tests/,/test/,*test*.py,/venv/,/env/,/.venv/,/.env/

# Skip specific tests that generate too many false positives
# B101: Use of assert detected - Assert statements are acceptable in test code
skips: B101
