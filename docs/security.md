# Security Guidelines

This document provides comprehensive security guidance for using the AI-powered workflow template safely and securely.

## üîí Quick Security Checklist

Before using this template, ensure you have:

- [ ] Set up secure API key management
- [ ] Configured repository security settings
- [ ] Understood workflow security implications
- [ ] Set up monitoring and audit procedures
- [ ] Reviewed security troubleshooting procedures
- [ ] Established regular security audit schedule

## üö® Critical Security Warnings

### ‚ö†Ô∏è API Key Exposure

**NEVER commit API keys to your repository.** Always use GitHub Secrets for sensitive credentials.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è GitHub Token Permissions

Use the minimum required permissions for GitHub Personal Access Tokens. Start with `repo` scope only.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è AI-Generated Code Review

**ALWAYS review AI-generated code** before merging. AI can introduce security vulnerabilities or expose sensitive information.

#### AI-Specific Security Risks

- **Prompt injection attacks**: Malicious content in issue descriptions
- **Information leakage**: AI may expose sensitive data in responses
- **Cost-based DoS**: Excessive API usage can drain resources
- **Code quality issues**: AI may generate insecure or inefficient code

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Public Repository Considerations

If your repository is public, be extra cautious about:

- Configuration files that might expose internal architecture
- Comments or documentation that reveal sensitive business logic
- Test data that might contain real information

## üîê API Key Management

### Secure Storage Practices

#### GitHub Secrets (Recommended)

```bash
# Interactive secure input (preferred)
gh secret set OPENROUTER_API_KEY
# Enter your API key when prompted

# Verify secret is set
gh secret list
```

#### Local Development

```bash
# Use .env file (never commit)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API key
echo ".env" >> .gitignore  # Ensure it's ignored
```

### Key Rotation Schedule

#### Regular Rotation

- **Monthly**: For production environments
- **Quarterly**: For development environments
- **Immediately**: If compromise suspected

#### Rotation Process

1. Generate new API key at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)
2. Update GitHub secrets
3. Test workflows with new key
4. Revoke old key
5. Document rotation date

### Monitoring and Usage

#### Track Usage

- Monitor API costs in OpenRouter dashboard
- Set up billing alerts
- Review usage patterns regularly

#### Security Monitoring

- Check for unusual API activity
- Monitor failed authentication attempts
- Review workflow logs for errors

## üõ°Ô∏è Repository Security

### GitHub Security Settings

#### Repository Settings

```bash
# Enable security features
gh repo edit --enable-vulnerability-alerts
gh repo edit --enable-automated-security-fixes
gh repo edit --enable-dependency-graph
```

#### Branch Protection Rules

- Require pull request reviews
- Dismiss stale reviews
- Require status checks
- Restrict pushes to main branch

#### Secret Scanning

- Enable secret scanning
- Configure custom patterns
- Review and resolve alerts

### Access Control

#### Team Permissions

- **Admin**: Repository owners only
- **Write**: Core contributors
- **Read**: General team members

#### Personal Access Tokens

- Use minimum required scopes
- Prefer fine-grained tokens
- Regular rotation schedule

## üîí Workflow Security

### GitHub Actions Security

#### Workflow Permissions

Use minimum required permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write
  actions: read
  # Add only what's needed
```

#### Security Best Practices

- Pin action versions to specific commits
- Use official actions when possible
- Avoid storing secrets in workflow files
- Limit workflow triggers appropriately

### AI Workflow Considerations

#### Code Review Requirements

- **Always review** AI-generated code
- **Test thoroughly** before merging
- **Check for security vulnerabilities**
- **Validate business logic**

#### Prompt Security

- Avoid including sensitive data in prompts
- Sanitize user input in issue descriptions
- Review AI responses for information leakage

#### Cost-Based Security

- Set spending limits to prevent abuse
- Monitor unusual cost patterns
- Implement circuit breakers

### Secret Management

#### Workflow Secrets

```yaml
# Access secrets securely
- name: Use API Key
  env:
    API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENROUTER_API_KEY }}
  run: |
    # Use $API_KEY in commands
```

#### Environment Variables

- Use GitHub environments for sensitive workflows
- Implement approval requirements
- Restrict environment access

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Daily Monitoring

- Review GitHub Actions logs for unusual activity
- Check API usage patterns for anomalies
- Monitor repository access logs

### Weekly Reviews

- Audit active GitHub tokens and their permissions
- Review recent AI-generated code changes
- Check for new security alerts or vulnerabilities

### Monthly Audits

- Complete security audit checklist
- Review and rotate API keys
- Update security documentation
- Assess and update security policies

## üö® Incident Response

### Immediate Actions (if security breach suspected)

1. **Revoke compromised credentials immediately**
2. **Disable affected workflows**
3. **Review recent repository activity**
4. **Document the incident**
5. **Notify team members**

### Investigation Steps

1. Identify the scope of the potential breach
2. Review logs and audit trails
3. Assess what data or systems may be affected
4. Determine root cause
5. Implement fixes and preventive measures

### Recovery Procedures

1. Generate new API keys and tokens
2. Update all affected secrets
3. Review and update security policies
4. Re-enable workflows with enhanced monitoring
5. Conduct post-incident review

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### API Key Problems

**Issue**: Workflows failing with authentication errors
**Solutions**:

- Verify secret is set: `gh secret list`
- Check key validity at OpenRouter
- Regenerate key if needed
- Ensure proper secret name

#### Permission Errors

**Issue**: GitHub Actions permission denied
**Solutions**:

- Check workflow permissions
- Verify token scopes
- Review repository settings
- Update team permissions

#### Security Scan Failures

**Issue**: Security scans reporting false positives
**Solutions**:

- Review and whitelist known safe patterns
- Update security tool configurations
- Add pragma comments for exceptions
- Update vulnerable dependencies

### Diagnostic Commands

#### Check Repository Security

```bash
# Check security settings
gh repo view --json securityAndAnalysis

# List security alerts
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/security-advisories

# Check workflow permissions
gh workflow list
```

#### Validate Secrets

```bash
# List repository secrets
gh secret list

# Test API key (without exposing it)
gh workflow run ai-task.yml
```

#### Review Logs

```bash
# Check workflow logs
gh run list --workflow=ai-task.yml
gh run view <run-id> --log
```

### Emergency Procedures
